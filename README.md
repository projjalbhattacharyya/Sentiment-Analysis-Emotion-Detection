# Sentiment-Analysis-Emotion-Detection
Sentiment Analysis website that can Detection Emotions from text, images and audio files. Deployed on Render.

**Note: The predictions on the deployed website may not be accurate because low-accuracy machine learning models are used. These models serve only as a visual representation of the project since TensorFlow could not be deployed due to dependencies on Windows-specific sub-packages like TensorFlow-Intel. Additionally, Render uses a Linux environment, which is incompatible with these dependencies. However, the code for both machine learning and neural network models is available, and a separate Flask application (tensor_app.py) has been created for TensorFlow-based predictions.**
